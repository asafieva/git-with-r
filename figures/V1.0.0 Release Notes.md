# Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Federated Data Service

## V1.0.0 Release Notes


The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is excited to announce the release of Version 1.0.0 (v1.0.0) of the Federated Data Service API ([link](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/)). This API allows users to pull data from various resources as if they were accessing a single virtual database, eliminating the need for data consolidation into a single centralized repository.

### Pilot Federated Data Resources

CCDI is piloting data federation with the following resources:
- Kids First Data Resource Center
- Pediatric Cancer Data Commons
- St. Jude Cloud
- Treehouse Childhood Cancer Data Initiative

These resources provide information about genomic, clinical, imaging, and biospecimen data. The list of participating organizations will expand as more contribute and implement CCDI’s federated data API.

### V1 API Data

| Source            | Participants | Samples | Files   |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| St. Jude Cloud    | 19,310       | 25,749  | 133,579 |
| UCSC - Treehouse  | 12,483       | 12,770  | 6       |
| Kids First – CHOP | 28,638       | 68,081  | 288,840 |
| PCDC – UChicago   | 22,328       |        |       |

### API Features

- The API does not deliver files but provides an open-access subset of metadata (e.g., demographics) matching a user’s search criteria.
- It also provides the location of the complete data set accessible according to the policies of each contributing resource.

### Harmonized Fields

Where possible, data has been harmonized to Common Data Elements provided by the Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (CaDSR) Common Data Elements (CDEs) to map attributes and allowable values ([https://cadsr.cancer.gov](https://cadsr.cancer.gov)). One exception is the diagnosis values, which include values from CNS Diagnosis Category ICD-0 3.2 and WHO CNS5 Integrated Diagnosis. Harmonized diagnosis values provided by Federation members are not always an exact match, and we recommend checking the unharmonized diagnosis values provided or contacting the member providing the data for further information. For the age data provided, some of the data has been converted from age in years to age in days, so this data should not be taken as exact values.

In future updates, we plan to add more harmonized data fields regarding the anatomic site the sample was taken from, the library selection method used to enrich the molecules for high throughput sequencing, the cellular material used for sequencing, and the molecules extracted from that material.

### Limitations to the API

The team has done its best to ensure the v1.0.0 release is fully functional and provides useful and accessible information to users. Compliance with the API specification and the data provided are the responsibility of the individual Federation members. The current filtering interface is through HTTP GET parameters, which are limited in scale and complexity. The API interface is also currently limited in the filtering options available; filtering by AND is accepted, but not OR or other operands. The API will also return results in alphabetical order based on subject or sample ID with no other options to sort the data. Summary statistics are only provided by the `/count` endpoint. Future iterations may update the filtering interface to use HTTP POST parameters, which can support larger payloads like querying lists of IDs and more complex filtering queries like numeric ranges or partial string matches for relevant fields.

### Access and Support

The API is publicly available at the following GitHub repository: [ccdi-federation-api](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/). This repository includes the following artifacts to support development and usage:
- V1.0.0 API Specification
- Release Notes
- YAML files
- WIKI defining harmonized attributes and definitions ([ccdi-federation-api-spec/wiki](https://github.com/CBIIT/ccdi-federation-api-spec/wiki))
- Swagger page to enable users to search aggregated nodes or choose individual federation nodes

### Troubleshooting

While the CCDI tests the API implementations of the Federation members, errors may occur that are beyond our control. For questions related to the Data Federation, please email [ncichildhoodcancerdatainitiative@mail.nih.gov](mailto:ncichildhoodcancerdatainitiative@mail.nih.gov). We look forward to seeing the community leverage this new API and contribute to the ongoing enhancement of the CCDI Federated Data Service.
